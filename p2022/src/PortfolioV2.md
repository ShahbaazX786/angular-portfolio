1. Revamp the navbar✅
  - Add whole name on the leftest side of the navbar.✅
    - The name has a hover effect in which upon hovering each letter will change color and float a bit up. ✅ 
  - In the middle section add 5 quick links✅
    - Home ✅

    - Contact✅
  - In the right most section of the navbar add social links and dark mode switcher✅
    - Twitter✅
    - Instagram✅
    - Linkedin✅
    - Toggle button for mode switcher.
      - the icon should change upon clicking to sun(for daymode) and moon(for nightmode)

2. Home section:
  - In the left section:✅
    - Add a single text line "Hey, I'm Shahbaaz Alam.✅
    - In the below line add what I mostly do in keywords (Ex:Developer,Thinker,binge-watcher,anime-nerd,content-creator etc you get the idea)✅
  - In the right section:
    - Add a profile picture of decent quality.
    - The image should have border or some svg at the background.✅
3. Projects section:
  - In large screen view there will be 4-5 scrollable cards which can scroll both left and right.[refer this link:https://codepen.io/joshhunt/pen/LVQZRa]
  - In small screen view there will be a single card in the middle and half card left and half card right.
4. Experience section:
  - This should also be implemented same as projects section. [refer this link:https://codepen.io/microfront/pen/veagoK]
5. pnf section:
  - The design needs to be simplified. I think its cluttered in css.
6. Footer section:✅
  - I simplified the design and now its a bit cool to look at.✅
    - Just make the pages and social contents as jcc and aic so that it matches the style of languages section contents style.✅
7. Skills section:
  - I am still not sure about how to revamp this.✅(But ASWT Helped me tho)


Ideas:
- For the about me page i'm thinking of keeping the text on the left side and my image on the right side.
- Also i will be holding the footer with 1 hand and another hand supporting my head just as sukuna sits while holding his face.(in jujutsu kaisen)(Lol comedy kab ku karna ki aisa pose).
