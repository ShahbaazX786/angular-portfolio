  - In small screen view there will be a single card in the middle and half card left and half card right.
4. Experience section:
  - This should also be implemented same as projects section. [refer this link:https://codepen.io/microfront/pen/veagoK]
5. pnf section:
  - The design needs to be simplified. I think its cluttered in css.
6. Footer section:✅
  - I simplified the design and now its a bit cool to look at.✅
    - Just make the pages and social contents as jcc and aic so that it matches the style of languages section contents style.✅
7. Skills section:
  - I am still not sure about how to revamp this.✅(But ASWT Helped me tho)


Ideas:
- For the about me page i'm thinking of keeping the text on the left side and my image on the right side.
- Also i will be holding the footer with 1 hand and another hand supporting my head just as sukuna sits while holding his face.(in jujutsu kaisen)(Lol comedy kab ku karna ki aisa pose).

Angular portfolio needs to be done with by feb.
- Add Experience Section.
	- Add current,
	- Add youtube exp,
	- Add school exp.
- Add interests Section.
	- Interests in the sense what you like to do in your free time (Not hobby).
	- Like learn react in next 6 months or something.
- Revamp Language selector with flag icons or heritage symbols just like in zomato language selection.
[Done✅]- But revamped it with flag icons and adding heritage symbols made the design weird so avoided it for now.
- Make Website less cluttered.[Done✅]
	- The total size of the website currently is around 16mb and it just keeps on adding more and more and reaches a total of 50mb by 
	  the time you checkout all the features of the websites.
- Add dark mode[Can only be done with angular material and scss(most tuts suggests this only)].
- Add some stylish fonts.
- Fix skills icons style(it is a bit weird when the icons shift down a little bit after hovering on it.)[Done✅]
- Revamp project cards.[Done✅]
	- I would say just display image and tech stach and if hovered on it then the card do some animation flip and shows title and description.[Done✅]
	- Also replace the project cards with working and good projects.[Done✅]
- Revamp Portfolio section[Done✅]
	- Make this a two sectioned page where you use mat tabs on the right side
  [Done✅]- However I used this approach in projects section and it was meaningful there.
	- And add instagram account on the left side with a follow button.
- Add links to social media links in footer[Done✅]
	- It would be cool to see if the icons color changed to original color just like you implemented in header icons.[Done✅]-But changed it to theme of the website (which is sky blue.)
	- Top Align all the content of the footer links.[Done✅]
- Revamp end credits section.
	- Make it more appealing.
	- Add some animations or something.[Done✅]
- Add animations to whole website.
	- The website looks super plane to me to be honest and i gotta use some shaped svgs as a background to make it more appealing.
	- Also while scrolling the elements should render with animation just like the animations in github home page.
- I noticed a jerk/slowdown at skills section.[Done✅]-Fixed (was being caused due to glass morphism css)
	- This may be caused due to some css or image size or all the elements in a small space or something.
	- I think the glassmorphism is causing this shit delay so just remove it to improve performance of the website.
- Add lazy loading.
	- implement lazy loading and SSR to make our app super lite.
