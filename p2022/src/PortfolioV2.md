1. Revamp the navbar✅
  - Add whole name on the leftest side of the navbar.✅
    - The name has a hover effect in which upon hovering each letter will change color and float a bit up. ✅ 
  - In the middle section add 5 quick links✅
    - Home ✅
    - About me✅
    - Portfolio✅
    - Projects✅
    - Contact✅
  - In the right most section of the navbar add social links and dark mode switcher✅(Done but only icons no functionality yet)
    - Twitter✅
    - Instagram✅
    - Linkedin✅
    - Toggle button for mode switcher.✅
      - the icon should change upon clicking to sun(for daymode) and moon(for nightmode)❌

2. Home section:
  - In the left section:✅
    - Add a single text line "Hey, I'm Shahbaaz Alam.✅
    - In the below line add what I mostly do in keywords (Ex:Developer,Thinker,binge-watcher,anime-nerd,content-creator etc you get the idea)✅
  - In the right section:
    - Add a profile picture of decent quality.❌
    - The image should have border or some svg at the background.✅
3. Projects section:
  - In large screen view there will be 4-5 scrollable cards which can scroll both left and right.[refer this link:https://codepen.io/joshhunt/pen/LVQZRa]
  - In small screen view there will be a single card in the middle and half card left and half card right.
4. Experience section:
  - This should also be implemented same as projects section. [refer this link:https://codepen.io/microfront/pen/veagoK]
5. pnf section:
  - The design needs to be simplified. I think its cluttered in css.
6. Footer section:✅
  - I simplified the design and now its a bit cool to look at.✅
    - Just make the pages and social contents as jcc and aic so that it matches the style of languages section contents style.✅
7. Skills section:
  - I am still not sure about how to revamp this.✅(But ASWT Helped me tho)


Ideas:
- For the about me page i'm thinking of keeping the text on the left side and my image on the right side.
- Also i will be holding the footer with 1 hand and another hand supporting my head just as sukuna sits while holding his face.(in jujutsu kaisen)(Lol comedy kab ku karna ki aisa pose).

Angular portfolio needs to be done with by feb.
- Add Experience Section.
	- Add current,
	- Add youtube exp,
	- Add school exp.
- Add interests Section.
	- Interests in the sense what you like to do in your free time (Not hobby).
	- Like learn react in next 6 months or something.
- Revamp Language selector with flag icons or heritage symbols just like in zomato language selection.
- Make Website less cluttered.
	- The total size of the website currently is around 16mb and it just keeps on adding more and more and reaches a total of 50mb by 
	  the time you checkout all the features of the websites.
- Add dark mode
- Add some stylish fonts.
- Fix skills icons style(it is a bit weird when the icons shift down a little bit after hovering on it.)
- Revamp project cards.
	- I would say just display image and tech stach and if hovered on it then the card do some animation flip and shows title and 
	  description.
	- Also replace the project cards with working and good projects.
- Revamp Portfolio section
	- Make this a two sectioned page where you use mat tabs on the right side
	- And add instagram account on the left side with a follow button.
- Add links to social media links in footer
	- It would be cool to see if the icons color changed to original color just like you implemented in header icons.
	- Top Align all the content of the footer links.
- Revamp end credits section.
	- Make it more appealing.
	- Add some animations or something.
- Add animations to whole website.
	- The website looks super plane to me to be honest and i gotta use some shaped svgs as a background to make it more appealing.
	- Also while scrolling the elements should render with animation just like the animations in github home page.
- I noticed a jerk/slowdown at skills section.
	- This may be caused due to some css or image size or all the elements in a small space or something.
	- I think the glassmorphism is causing this shit delay so just remove it to improve performance of the website.
- Add lazy loading.
	- implement lazy loading and SSR to make our app super lite.
